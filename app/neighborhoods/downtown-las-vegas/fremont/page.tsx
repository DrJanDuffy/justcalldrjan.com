          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Fremont Street represents Downtown Las Vegas's entertainment district, offering urban lofts, condos, and walkable proximity to Fremont Street Experience. For homeowners whose properties didn't sell, understanding Fremont Street's urban positioning is essential for successful relisting.

                Fremont Street offers walkable access to Fremont Street Experience, downtown entertainment, dining, and nightlife that creates unique urban value within Downtown Las Vegas.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">

            Fremont Street real estate has specific characteristics that can challenge sellers who don't understand this urban entertainment district's unique market dynamics.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Fremont Street's biggest advantage is entertainment district proximity. Listings that don't highlight walkability and entertainment access miss urban value that defines Fremont Street appeal.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Marketing Fremont Street as generic Downtown Las Vegas misses unique selling points. Buyers specifically choosing Fremont Street want entertainment district access - generic downtown marketing doesn't communicate this.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Fremont Street attracts urban professionals and empty nesters seeking walkable downtown living. Marketing to generic Las Vegas buyers who don't value urban lifestyle wastes advertising while missing interested urban buyers.
