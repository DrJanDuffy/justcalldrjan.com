              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                MacDonald Ranch offers golf course homes with course views and golf access that command premium pricing within Henderson. Properties backing to golf courses sell at significant premium to comparable homes without course access.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Many expired listings in MacDonald Ranch failed to showcase golf course advantages effectively. Properties positioned without highlighting course views miss the golf premium that defines MacDonald Ranch market value.

            MacDonald Ranch real estate has specific characteristics that can challenge sellers who don't understand this golf course community's unique market dynamics.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                MacDonald Ranch's biggest advantage is golf course access. Listings that don't highlight course views and golf benefits miss the golf premium that MacDonald Ranch commands.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Marketing MacDonald Ranch as generic Henderson misses unique selling points. Buyers specifically choosing MacDonald Ranch want golf course benefits - generic Henderson marketing doesn't communicate this.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                MacDonald Ranch attracts golf enthusiasts and buyers seeking course views. Marketing to generic Henderson buyers who don't value golf access wastes advertising while missing interested golf course buyers.
