                Clark County School District includes many A-rated schools, especially in areas like Summerlin, Henderson, and Green Valley. School choice and quality are major factors in homebuying decisions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Neighborhoods zoned to top schools like Palo Verde High School, Coronado High, and Advanced Technologies Academy often command premium prices and faster sales. Many families specifically search homes by school zone.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                Las Vegas is renowned for master-planned communities that offer residents a complete lifestyle package. Summerlin, developed by The Howard Hughes Corporation, spans 22,500 acres with parks, trails, schools, shopping, and entertainment all within walking distance of many homes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                These communities feature homeowners associations that maintain common areas, organize events, and provide security. The HOA amenities often include pools, fitness centers, playgrounds, and community parks that create a strong sense of community.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Buying in a master-planned community typically offers better resale value, stronger appreciation rates, and higher quality of life. The planning ensures proper infrastructure, traffic flow, and aesthetic standards that individual developments may lack.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">New Construction vs Established Neighborhoods</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                Las Vegas offers both brand-new construction and established neighborhoods, each with distinct advantages. New construction areas like Skye Canyon, Inspirada, and Cadence offer modern floor plans, energy-efficient features, and the latest in home design and technology.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                Established neighborhoods like Spring Valley, Paradise, and parts of Henderson offer mature landscaping, established amenities, and often larger lot sizes. These areas typically have lower HOA fees and more established tree canopies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Your choice depends on priorities: new builds offer customization and latest features, while established neighborhoods offer character, lower costs, and proven appreciation. Many buyers find value in both options across Las Vegas's diverse market.
