              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Small-Town Character Appeal</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">Boulder City attracts buyers seeking lifestyle benefits: outdoor recreation, lake access, quiet neighborhoods, and small-town atmosphere. Properties emphasizing these advantages connect with Boulder City buyers effectively.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">Many expired listings in Boulder City missed the mark by using generic suburb marketing that didn't highlight outdoor recreation, lake access, and quiet living that defines Boulder City's appeal.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">Dr. Jan helps you showcase Boulder City's unique lifestyle advantages: proximity to Lake Mead, outdoor recreation, quiet neighborhoods, and escape from Las Vegas hustle while remaining close enough for employment.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">Boulder City attracts retirees and relocators seeking outdoor lifestyle without Las Vegas Strip intensity. These buyers value quiet neighborhoods, mountain views, and recreational access over urban density.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">Your expired listing likely used generic marketing that didn't speak to Boulder City's specific buyer motivations. Dr. Jan targets outdoor enthusiasts, retirees, and relocators specifically.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">Her marketing strategy emphasizes Boulder City's unique position: outdoor recreation hub, retirement destination, and Las Vegas proximity without Strip intensity. This messaging connects with Boulder City's actual buyer pool.</p>

            Why Boulder City Homes Don't Sell
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Boulder City real estate has specific characteristics that can challenge sellers who don't understand the market's unique dynamics.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Generic Suburban Marketing</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">Boulder City isn't a generic suburb. Buyers come here for specific lifestyle reasons: outdoor recreation, lake access, quiet living. Generic marketing that doesn't communicate these advantages misses Boulder City buyers entirely.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-yellow-200">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Missing Recreational Advantages</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">Boulder City's biggest selling points are recreational: Lake Mead proximity, mountain hiking, outdoor activities. Listings that don't highlight these advantages compete poorly against those that do.</p>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-blue-200">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Wrong Buyer Targeting</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">Boulder City attracts retirees, outdoor enthusiasts, and those seeking quieter living. Marketing to generic Las Vegas buyers who don't understand Boulder City's appeal wastes advertising while missing interested buyers.</p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">The Boulder City Messaging Challenge</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">Boulder City homes that didn't sell often failed to communicate the area's unique lifestyle advantages. Buyers considering Boulder City want outdoor recreation, quiet neighborhoods, and escape from urban intensity.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">Generic marketing that positions Boulder City as "just another Las Vegas suburb" misses the point entirely. Your marketing needs to speak to outdoor enthusiasts, retirees, and those seeking lifestyle advantages.</p>
