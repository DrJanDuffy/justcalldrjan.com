            Understanding Las Vegas Property Tax

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Las Vegas property tax is important consideration for homeowners and buyers.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Nevada has one of the lowest property tax rates in the United States, with effective rate typically around 0.6% of assessed value. This low property tax rate makes Las Vegas homes more affordable than higher-tax states and reduces ongoing ownership costs.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Nevada Constitution caps property tax increases at 3% annually for residential properties, protecting homeowners from dramatic tax increases. This tax cap provides stability and predictability for Las Vegas property owners.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                For Las Vegas homebuyers, understanding property tax implications helps calculate true homeownership costs. Low property taxes contribute to affordability and make Las Vegas real estate attractive compared to high-tax states.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Las Vegas property tax is based on assessed value determined by Clark County Assessor's Office. Assessed value considers property improvements, recent sales in area, and market conditions. Property owners receive assessment notices and can appeal if they believe assessment is incorrect.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                New Las Vegas homebuyers should understand that property tax assessment may change after purchase based on purchase price. This reassessment ensures property taxes reflect current market value rather than previous owner's assessment.
