            What is Las Vegas MLS?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            The Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is comprehensive database of Las Vegas real estate listings accessible to licensed real estate agents. MLS provides centralized system for sharing listings, market data, and property information among Las Vegas real estate professionals and their clients.
          </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">How MLS Works</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Las Vegas MLS contains all active listings submitted by licensed Las Vegas real estate agents. When agent lists your Las Vegas property on MLS, it becomes available to all other MLS participants and their buyers, maximizing exposure and reach to qualified buyers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                MLS listings include comprehensive property details: photos, descriptions, pricing, features, neighborhood information, and showing instructions. This centralized system ensures Las Vegas buyers and their agents can find all available properties efficiently.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                For Las Vegas homes that didn't sell, MLS listing is essential but not sufficient. Professional agents use MLS as foundation while adding marketing channels that reach buyers beyond basic MLS exposure: digital advertising, social media, luxury portals, and targeted marketing.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">MLS vs. General Marketing</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Simply listing on Las Vegas MLS doesn't guarantee sale. Successful Las Vegas MLS listings require professional presentation: quality photography, compelling descriptions, accurate pricing, and strategic positioning that attracts buyers effectively.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Professional Las Vegas agents like Dr. Jan use MLS as starting point while adding comprehensive marketing beyond MLS: professional photography, virtual tours, digital advertising, social media promotion, and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices luxury channels.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                For expired listings, MLS listing likely existed before - but previous marketing may have been insufficient. Dr. Jan's approach ensures MLS listing is professionally presented while adding marketing channels that previous agents may not have utilized effectively.

            Why MLS Matters for Las Vegas Real Estate
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Las Vegas MLS provides essential exposure to all licensed real estate agents and their buyers. However, successful sales require more than basic MLS listing - professional presentation, strategic pricing, and comprehensive marketing make the difference.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Professional photos make Las Vegas MLS listings stand out. Poor photography makes buyers skip listings online, while quality images attract serious interest and showing requests.

                  Correct pricing in Las Vegas MLS listings attracts qualified buyers and enables competitive offers. Overpricing causes listings to sit unsold despite MLS exposure.

            If your Las Vegas property was listed on MLS and didn't sell, simply relisting on MLS with same approach won't create different results. Successful relisting requires addressing issues that prevented initial sale: pricing, presentation, marketing reach, or positioning.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Dr. Jan analyzes your previous Las Vegas MLS listing to identify what prevented sale: was pricing above market comparables, were photos poor quality, was marketing insufficient beyond MLS, or was positioning wrong relative to competition?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                This diagnostic analysis ensures relisting on Las Vegas MLS addresses specific issues rather than repeating same approach. Targeted fixes create results where generic MLS relisting failed.
