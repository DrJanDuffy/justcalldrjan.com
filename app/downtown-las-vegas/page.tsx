            Understanding Downtown Las Vegas Real Estate
          </h2>
          
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Downtown Las Vegas is experiencing a renaissance, with new developments, businesses, and attractions bringing renewed energy to the area. For homeowners whose properties didn't sell, understanding Downtown's unique market dynamics is essential for successful relisting.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Downtown Las Vegas features historic homes mixed with modern condos and lofts. The area's character attracts both investors and residents seeking urban living outside the Strip's entertainment corridor. This diversity can make positioning challenging for homes that didn't sell initially.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Many expired listings in Downtown suffer from pricing that doesn't account for the area's transition. Properties priced for "what it used to be" miss buyers excited about "what it's becoming." Dr. Jan helps you price for the Downtown of today and tomorrow.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Downtown attracts buyers looking for walkability, character, and investment potential. Your home that didn't sell needs positioning that highlights these Downtown advantages to the right buyers at the right price point.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                With World Market Center, Container Park, Fremont Street Experience, and ongoing development, Downtown Las Vegas is attracting new residents, businesses, and investors. This growth creates both opportunity and competition for sellers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The influx of new construction and renovations means older Downtown homes that didn't sell need careful positioning against this new competition. Dr. Jan helps you highlight your home's authentic Downtown character while demonstrating value against newer properties.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Understanding which buyers are coming to Downtown and why they're choosing it helps target marketing effectively. Your expired listing likely missed these buyers; Dr. Jan ensures they see and choose your property on relisting.

            Why Your Downtown Home Didn't Sell
          </h2>
          
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Downtown Las Vegas has unique characteristics that can trip up unprepared sellers. Understanding these specific issues helps identify what prevented your sale and how to fix it successfully.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Downtown is changing rapidly. Properties priced based on old comps miss today's reality. New developments are raising prices in some areas while others wait for transformation. Your price needs to reflect current Downtown valuation, not historical averages.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Downtown attracts specific buyer types: investors, urban living enthusiasts, and those seeking character homes. Generic marketing that doesn't speak to these buyers wastes time and money. Your home that didn't sell likely reached the wrong audience.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Historic charm needs balance with modern expectations. Homes showing their age without highlighting character features struggle to compete. Professional staging and photography that showcase Downtown living make dramatic differences.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Downtown Las Vegas homes that didn't sell often struggled with positioning. Buyers coming to Downtown want character, location benefits, and value. Generic listings don't communicate these Downtown-specific advantages.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Dr. Jan specializes in Downtown Las Vegas real estate and understands how to position historic homes against new construction, highlight walkability and transit advantages, and communicate Downtown lifestyle benefits that attract the right buyers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Her marketing targets Downtown's actual buyer pool: those excited about urban living, investment potential, and character homes in a transforming neighborhood. This precision avoids wasted marketing dollars and connects your home with interested buyers.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Dr. Jan understands Downtown's nuances: which blocks are appreciating, what buyers are seeking, and how historic charm commands premium pricing. Her knowledge of Downtown development and buyer patterns informs pricing and marketing strategies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                She tracks Downtown comps specifically, watching how comparable properties are selling, what features buyers are paying premium for, and how new developments affect existing home values. This Downtown-specific expertise ensures your pricing is accurate.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Her marketing strategy targets Downtown buyers specifically: urban living enthusiasts, investors seeking cash flow potential, and those seeking character homes. This precision avoids generic marketing that wastes budget reaching disinterested buyers.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Your Downtown home has unique selling points: walkability, historic character, investment potential, transit access, and proximity to attractions. Generic listings don't communicate these advantages effectively.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Dr. Jan's marketing showcases these Downtown-specific benefits with professional photography and copy that highlights urban living, transit access, entertainment proximity, and character that new construction cannot replicate.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Her approach positions your home against the market's new construction by emphasizing features that only historic Downtown properties offer. This differentiation helps attract buyers seeking authentic Downtown character.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If your Downtown home didn't sell initially, likely issues included pricing that didn't reflect Downtown's current market, marketing that didn't reach Downtown buyers specifically, or presentation that didn't showcase character advantages. Dr. Jan addresses each systematically.
