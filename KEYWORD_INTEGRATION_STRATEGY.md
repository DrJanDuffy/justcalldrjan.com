   - Hyperlocal angle: "Best marketing tools for Las Vegas real estate agents"

2. **"Real Estate Agent Scripts for Las Vegas"**
   - Page: `/resources/realtor-scripts-las-vegas`
   - Content: Localized scripts for Las Vegas market
   - Hyperlocal angle: "Cold calling scripts for Las Vegas expired listings"

3. **"Las Vegas Real Estate Website Design"**
   - Page: `/resources/real-estate-website-design-las-vegas`
   - Content: Website platforms in Las Vegas context
   - Hyperlocal angle: "Best real estate websites for Las Vegas agents"

## Recommended Page Additions

### Option 1: Resources/Tools Pages (Hyperlocalized)
```
/resources/marketing-tools-las-vegas
/resources/real-estate-scripts-las-vegas

```

### Option 2: Blog-Style Educational Content

- Add: "Comprehensive marketing platform" (Boomtown related)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Hyperlocal Tool Integration (Week 1)
1. Add sections to existing pages mentioning tools in Las Vegas context
2. Update `/about` page to mention marketing tools used
3. Update `/how-it-works` to highlight technology/marketing tools

### Phase 2: New Resource Pages (Week 2)
1. Create `/resources` directory
2. Add localized tool pages
3. Link from main navigation

### Phase 3: Blog/Educational Content (Week 3)
1. Create blog section
2. Weekly posts combining tools + hyperlocal
3. Internal linking to neighborhood pages

## Recommended Next Steps

**Focus on Hyperlocal Keywords FIRST:**
1. ✅ Already have 11 zip code pages (good!)
2. ✅ Already have neighborhood pages (good!)
3. Add more hyperlocal variations:
   - "expired listings [neighborhood]"
   - "homes that didn't sell [zip code]"
   - "real estate agent [neighborhood] expired listings"

**Then Integrate Tool Keywords:**
1. Add tool mentions naturally in content
2. Create resource pages
3. Educational content about tools

**Avoid:**
- Generic tool review pages (not hyperlocal)
- Non-localized tool content
- Pages that don't serve Las Vegas market

## Conclusion

The provided keywords are valuable but need hyperlocal integration. The current site structure is excellent for hyperlocal SEO. Focus on:

1. **Maintain hyperlocal focus** (neighborhoods, zip codes)
2. **Integrate tools naturally** in existing content
3. **Create localized resource pages** that combine tools + location
4. **Prioritize search intent**: "Las Vegas real estate agent" > "real estate tools"

The site is already well-positioned for hyperlocal SEO. Tool keywords should supplement, not replace, the hyperlocal strategy.
