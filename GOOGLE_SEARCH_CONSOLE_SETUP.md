## Adding New Pages

When adding new pages, update `app/sitemap.ts` to include them in the sitemap.

## Monitoring

After setup, monitor in Google Search Console:
- **Performance** - Track impressions, clicks, CTR, and average position
- **Coverage** - Check indexed pages
- **Mobile Usability** - Ensure mobile-friendly experience
- **Core Web Vitals** - Monitor page speed and user experience metrics

## SEO Best Practices

1. Each page has exactly one H1 tag
2. Each page has multiple H2 and H3 tags for structure
3. Pages have at least 1000 words of content
4. Meta descriptions are optimized for each page
5. Open Graph tags are in place for social sharing
6. Schema markup can be added for enhanced search features

## Notes

- The sitemap updates automatically when you deploy new pages
- Google typically crawls the sitemap weekly
- You can request manual indexing for important new pages
- Monitor for 404 errors and fix them promptly
